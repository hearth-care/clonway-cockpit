# The agent screen model

`clonway_cockpit.model.ScreenModel` is the structured, JSON-serialisable description
of a cockpit screen that agents read and assert against (via `Host.on_screen` or
`clonway_cockpit.agent.CockpitDriver`). The human cockpit still renders Rich
renderables; the model is built from the same inputs by the `model_*` functions in
`render.py`, and parity tests keep the two in agreement.

## `Row.id` — a semi-public contract

Agents key on `Row.id`. Treat these as stable; changing one is a breaking change for
any agent script that asserts on it.

| Screen (`ScreenModel.kind`) | Row ids |
|---|---|
| `home` | `pill:<i>`, `need:<i>`, `shelf:<LETTER>` |
| `shelf_menu` | `option:<key>`, `back` |
| `walk.preflight` | `change:<i>`, `precond:<i>` |
| `walk.result` | (prose region, no rows) |

`ScreenModel.selection` is the id of the currently-cursored row (or `null`).
`ScreenModel.actions` is a best-effort list of keys/verbs the screen honours.
`ScreenModel.meta` carries screen-specific facts (e.g. preflight `ready`/`equivalent_cli`,
result `ok`/`links`).

## Driving headlessly

```python
from clonway_cockpit.agent import CockpitDriver

driver = CockpitDriver(host, keys=["c", "n", "q"])  # open shelf C, cancel preflight, quit
stream = driver.run()
assert any(s.kind == "walk.preflight" for s in stream)
```

## Scope

M1 covers home, shelf menu, walk preflight, walk result. Follow-on (M1-rest): progress,
doctor, filter, note, capability card, the confirm screens, help. Worker shelf-report
screens and the walk review/apply screen adopt the model in M3.
